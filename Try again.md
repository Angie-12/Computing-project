The moment I picked it up, it nuzzled into my hand. Gently, I stroked its blueish tinted silver fur, as soft as silk. Feeling the warm comfort of my hand, the puppy semmed to let out a contented sigh and relaxed further. I got up and brushed the snow off, unsure of what to do. It's mother must have been killed I supposed. For two days, I had been watching it. Still, there was no sign of its mother. Well, I couldn't leave it here, that was for sure, it would be dead by next morning. However, I struggled to think of the notion of my parents agreeing to let me bring it home and raising him. They weren't very fond of pets. "Maybe I could keep you a secret, our secret." I whispered softly to the fragile bundle of fur in my hands, my breath coming out in a small puff of fog as a small smile tugged at my lips.
Little did I know, this would be the start of a strong friendship and faithful companion who would bring much joy to my life...after a tragic event.
A month passed, (Name?)grew fast. I took care of him in my tree house, hidden away from my parents. 
Ominous gray clouds scattered across the sky. I decided to go out for a walk with () before my parents woke up and before it started raining. () needed to stretch his legs. Dawn was approaching so it wasn't too dark. We didn't go very far. An hour later, the faint smell of smoke, ashes and something burning reached my nose, brought along by the breeze. With a sinking feeling of dread, I realised that it was coming from the direction of home. Turning around, I saw a column of grey smoke rising into the air, made vivid by the light of the half risen sun. In one swift motion, I scooped up () and started running, faster then I had ever run brfore, tripping over roots and bumps. My breaths came out ragged, please be okay, please be okay, I thought to myself over and over again.
