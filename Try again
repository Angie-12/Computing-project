The moment I picked it up, it nuzzled into my hand. Gently, I stroked its blueish tinted silver fur, as soft as silk. Feeling the warm comfort of my hand, the puppy semmed to let out a contented sigh and relaxed further. I got up and brushed the snow off, unsure of what to do. It's mother must have been killed I supposed. For two days, I had been watching it. Still, there was no sign of its mother. Well, I couldn't leave it here, that was for sure, it would be dead by next morning. However, I struggled to think of the notion of my parents agreeing to let me bring it home and raising him. They weren't very fond of pets. "Maybe I could keep you a secret, our secret." I whispered softly to the fragile bundle of fur in my hands, my breath coming out in a small puff of fog as a small smile tugged at my lips.
