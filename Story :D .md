A figure stood there, a fading silhouette against a rapidly darkening sky. Night was approaching. Soon, brilliant stars filled the endless black above. Something was off however, it was silent, too silent...but he felt no fear.
Slowly it turned around, glowing blue eyes piecing the dark, narrowing in on...him. The wind seemed to blow harder, it whistled in his ears as he stared at those eyes. He wondered what would happen next. For a split second, all was inky blackness, not even a glimmer of light from the stars seeping through. Suddenly, the world around him was burning, blazing flames leaping high into the air, unbearable heat. The figure was gone. Sweat trickled down his forehead and he felt faint. Just then, a huge wave of water rose, looming over the world. With a terrific crash it descended, sweeping over everything. He could neither breathe nor struggle. For a moment, there was peace ; calm filled him. Was this a memory from a past or a vision of the future? Then, the world went dark.
